### Reload bash's .profile without restarting shell:


```
    $ source ~/.profile
    $ . ~/.profile
```

>  If something is **removed** from `~/.profile`, that change will **not** take effect after `. ~/.profile` reload. For example, add a function to `~/.profile`: `function externalip () { curl http://ipecho.net/plain; echo; }`, then `~/.profile` - IT WORKS. Now remove that function from `~/.profile`, then `. ~/.profile` again. The function is still available - only restarting (log out & in) will remove it. 

### Clear the contents of a file without deleting the file:

```bash
$ > somefile.xyz					# works in bash
# -OR-
% : > $LOGFILE						# works in zsh
# -OR-
$ truncate -s 0 test.txt	# any system w/ truncate
```

### List all directories - not files, just directories:

```bash
$ find . -type d   # list all dirs in pwd (.)
```

### Sequential shell command execution:

Sometimes we want to execute a series of commands, but only if all previous commands execute successfully. In this case, we should use **`&&`** to join the commands in the sequence: 

```bash
cd /home/auser && cp /utilities/backup_home.sh ./ && chown auser ./backup_home.sh
```
At other times we want to execute a series of commands regardless of whether or not previous commands executed successfully. In that case, we should use **`;`** to join the commands in the sequence:

```bash
cp /home/pi/README /home/auser; rsync -av /home/auser /mnt/BackupDrv/auser_backup/
```

### Get a date-time stamp for a log:

It's often useful to insert a date-time stamp in a log file, inserted in a string, etc. Easily done w/ `date`: 

```bash
echo $(date) >> mydatalog.txt   # using `echo` inserts a newline after the date & time 
# log entry will be in this format: Tue Mar 24 04:28:31 CDT 2020 + newline
echo $(date -u)                 # `-u` gives UTC 
```

If you need more control over the format, use `printf` w/ `date`:

```bash
printf '%s' "$(date)" >> mydatalog.txt	# no newline is output
# log entry will be in this format: Tue Mar 24 04:28:31 CDT 2020 
printf '%s\n' "$(date)" >> mydatalog.txt	# newline is output
```

There are numerous options with the `date` command. Check `man date`, or peruse this [*Lifewire* article 'How to Display the Date and Time Using Linux Command Line'](https://www.lifewire.com/display-date-time-using-linux-command-line-4032698). 

### String manipulation with bash:

It's often useful to manipulate string variables in bash. These websites have some examples: [website 1](https://www.tutorialkart.com/bash-shell-scripting/bash-string-manipulation-examples/); [website 2](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2010/07/bash-string-manipulation/). For example:

```bash
$ str1="for everything there is a "
$ str2="reason"
$ str3="season"
$ echo $str1$str2; echo $str1$str3
for everything there is a reason
for everything there is a season
```
