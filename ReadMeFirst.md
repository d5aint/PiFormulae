It seems to me that a lot of people follow instructions on how to set up their microSD card (Raspberry Pi's 'hard drive'), but don't give much thought to what comes afterwards. That's understandable, and it's generally not that big a deal if you're connecting a keyboard, mouse and TV/monitor. In the "GUI" environment, you can issue commands to your RPi, and there are tools and tips and cues to point you toward connecting to your network, and other basic tasks that are typically done first. 

However, some users don't want to (or aren't able to) connect keyboards, mice and monitors. This is how I usually do it; I run my RPi's ["headless"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_computer)... I have one "head" on my MacBook, and I don't want any more heads to deal with :)  I personally feel that's "how it should be", but after living with the Raspberry Pi 3B+ for a short while, I can easily see that it's not far off when an RPi can serve as a reasonable hardware platform for general use; surfing the Internet, email, etc.
