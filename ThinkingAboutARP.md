# Thinking about ARP... what is it, and how do we use it? 

You can think of ARP as ["where the rubber meets the road"](https://www.knowyourphrase.com/when-the-rubber-hits-the-road) in IP networks. Many people are aware that the Internet Protocol (IP) uses a system of IP addresses, routers and DNS to get packets moved from source to destination. Fewer are familiar with the fact that the "MAC address" is the address that matters for delivery! IP addresses are ephemeral; they can be, and often are, changed frequently. But the MAC address serves the role of a "permanent address", and is used in networks to determine which host computer/interface takes delivery of the data packet. This role as permanent address was established when it was decided that each and every Ethernet adapter would have a unique address embedded in the hardware during the manufacturing process.

Well, that was the theory at the time anyway :)   Since that time, it's been decided that our systems will be allowed to "override" that permanent hardware address. It's [quite easy to change the MAC address of an adapter](https://www.howtogeek.com/192173/how-and-why-to-change-your-mac-address-on-windows-linux-and-mac/), and there are even good reasons for doing so. 

ARP has a rather arcane protocol that has been [described](http://www.erg.abdn.ac.uk/users/gorry/course/inet-pages/arp.html), [delineated](https://www.tummy.com/articles/networking-basics-how-arp-works/) and [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol) in numerous sources. The definitive specification is [RFC 826](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc826.txt), and it serves the basis for much of the ARP-specific networking software that has been coded since about 1982. 

It seems interesting (to me at least) that although the MAC address was developed with the notion that it would be a permanent address with an 'irrevocably-encoded-in-hardware' mentality, that it is used in an even more ephemeral context than the IP address! I say this because MAC Addresses are stored in something called the "ARP cache" in your computer, and that cache **typically** "expires" and is deleted under software control every 60 seconds in many systems! This seems very odd to me, but I'll confess that there may be good reasons for such a short lifetime of which I'm unaware. What I do know is that this short lifetime can make certain chores more difficult; e.g. [finding my new Raspberry Pi's IP address on my local network](./PiFormulae/FindMyPi.md). 

Oh... and don't get ARP confused with ARPA! ARPA was the Advanced Research Projects Agency, an agency of the US government that funded (?) the initial development of the Internet! ARPA eventually morphed into DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency), and adopted a more, uh... nefarious (?) agenda. However, it is interesting perhaps that initial developement of ARP was funded by ARPA :)
