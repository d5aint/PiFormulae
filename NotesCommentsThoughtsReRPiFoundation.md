#### Some Notes, Comments & Thoughts on the Raspberry Pi Foundation:

The [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) oversees design, production, sales, marketing and all other operations related to the Raspberry Pi device. `The Organization` is a registered charity in the United Kingdom with several subsidiaries world wide. There is a [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi_Foundation) on `The Organization`. In 2018, `The Organization` had income in excess of £31M (~$40M USD), a staff of over 130 people, a board of trustees, and a rather complex organizational structure. More information on `The Organization`is available on the [UK's Charity Commission website](https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?subid=0&regid=1129409). 

I am not an accountant, but that's quite a charity to my way of thinking. And speaking of "charity", `The Organization` spends less than 28% of its *Expenditures* on "Charitable Activities"; less than 25% of its *Income and Endowments* ([ref](https://beta.charitycommission.gov.uk/charity-details/?subid=0&regid=1129409)). As an *uninformed opinion*, I wonder if the charity angle is more about avoiding UK taxes? 

But I don't care much about that - taxation is a matter for the citizens of the UK and their government. What I ***do*** care about is the paucity of hardware specifications `The Organization` has published. `The Organization` has stated the *purpose* of the Raspberry Pi development is, *"to promote the study of computer science and related topics, especially at  school level, and to put the fun back into learning computing."* Hmmm... OK, but I do not understand how that stated purpose is best served by withholding hardware documentation from its users. I think this smacks of *insincerity*.

From an answer to a [question on the Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/a/95475/83790) Stack Exchange site:

> You may have noticed that I used the term "It's my understanding ..." in my answer. You may not be aware of this, but the [Raspberry Pi Foundation](http://raspberrypi.org), a UK "charity", does not publish specifications or schematics for the GPIO - nor in fact for much of the hardware. If it strikes you as odd that a charity would produce and promote the RPi to hobbyists as a "learning device", and then withhold most of the hardware technical details as proprietary, then welcome to the club!

> The fallout from *The Foundation's* paucity of hardware documentation is that "the community" has been motivated to conjur the missing specifications and details from observation, experimentation, comparison and yes, some speculation and guesswork. The [GPIO Electrical Specifications](http://www.mosaic-industries.com/embedded-systems/microcontroller-projects/raspberry-pi/gpio-pin-electrical-specifications) is one source of information and documentation, there's also [this on GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/documentation/tree/master/hardware/raspberrypi/gpio), and there's the [Everything You Wanted to Know About GPIO But Were Afraid to Ask website](https://www.circuits.dk/everything-about-raspberry-gpio/). You may refer to these sources for the missing hardware documentation on Raspberry Pi.

Unlike most of the rest of the *recipes* in this repo, this piece is subjective and based on opinion - my opinion. That said, I do like the idea of being open-minded, and so would welcome your opinion.
