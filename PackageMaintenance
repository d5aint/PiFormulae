the sequence for installing a new package; e.g. `git` is:
> df -h

> sudo apt-get update

> sudo apt-get dist-upgrade

> sudo apt-get install git 

> sudo apt-get clean

The first command (`df -h`) will give you a chance to make sure you've got space on your "drive" for the installation. This is important as `apt` doesn't verify this before it starts! The last command (`sudo apt-get clean`) will __"take out the trash"__, and help conserve space on your "drive".
